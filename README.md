# allergy-detector

## Project Description 

This is a project inspired by my sister who has severe Ezcema allergies. 
Essentially, the user will be able to create a list of allergies and add, delete or view them. 
Users can also look up a beuaty product after to see if the product contains the ingredients they're allergic to. 

This project was made in parallel with Capital One's Tech Mini Mester.
